# Lorawan
This is about the second practical assignment of IOT course. End devices used in this assigment were 
Arduino, Multiprotocol shield for arduino and Libelium LoRaWAN module.

Below is a list of the tasks we implemented.
• Storing security keys
• Management of security session context (e.g. network and application session
key derivations, managing context switches)
• Authentication and integrity check for downlink messages
• Frame counter and JoinNonce checks to ensure freshness of downlink messages
• Encryption and MIC calculation for uplink messages
All these tasks were implemented as parts of the LoRaWAN protocol implementation on a LoRaWAN
end-device.
